        AppExert Labs OPC Pvt Ltd (SAC: 8314), with addresses at 
        2001 Blvd. Robert Bourassa, Suite 1700, Montreal, QC, H3A 2A6, Canada, and RMZ Millenia Business
        Park, Campus 4B Chennai 600096, India, offer services to companies
        referred to as Clients as per the terms of services mentioned below. The
        Clients accept the terms by signing the Agreement or making Payment
        towards the invoice.
      </p>

      <h2 className='section-heading'>Services</h2>

      <p className='section-paragraph'>
        Depending on the services required by the Clients, we will form a team
        of skilled and experienced professionals as per the Invoice or the
        Agreement. We will introduce the client to the team who will work with
        them on the specific project. AppExert takes the responsibility of
        creating sprints that are agreeable to the client. The team&apos;s work
        on the tasks of the Client&apos;s project, project planning, and
        management, including time tracking, is handled by us. The Services will
        be delivered to the clients at the agreed-upon intervals called Sprints.
        For instance, if the time interval is 2 calendar weeks for the agreed
        tasks, the team shall deliver the same unless there are major
        roadblocks. The team members may work as part-time employees having to
        clock more than 30 hours of work or as full-time employees clocking more
        than 60 hours of work. Certain team members may have different minimum
        work hours as agreed by both parties.
      </p>

      <p className='section-paragraph'>
        The team commences work only after the Client has approved the team
        members provided by Us. It also needs to be approved by the client. The
        work will commence once We receive the deposit. If more information is
        needed for the completion of certain tasks, it has to be provided within
        3 working days after the receipt of the request. Once the Sprint is
        complete, the client has to review the services and check if it complies
        with the agreed work and industry standards.
      </p>

      <p className='section-paragraph'>
        The client can accept the work done during the Sprint or reject it
        within 5 calendar days following the Sprint End date. If the work is
        rejected, the Client shall provide a detailed review demonstrating that
        the task is not as per agreed terms. The tasks not rejected by the
        client during this period are deemed as accepted. Any rejections sent
        after the expiration of the rejection period, the Services are deemed to
        be provided and accepted. However, these tasks can be planned in the
        next Sprint cycle, and the Client must pay for those tasks. But if,
        after the review, it has been found that there are deviations from what
        was agreed with the Clients or is not as per common industry practices,
        the time spent on those tasks will be disregarded for the calculation of
        the fee.
      </p>

      <h2 className='section-heading'>Client Access to Resources</h2>

      <p className='section-paragraph'>
        The team working on the project shall provide the client with access to
        the task management system used for building it. As part of the
        handover, the source code will be provided using a version control
        system, interface design, Jira, or other resources as agreed by both
        parties.
      </p>

      <h2 className='section-heading'>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>

      <p className='section-paragraph'>
        After completing the tasks, the team members transfer the IP rights to
        the clients for which they have paid. The client shall retain any IP
        rights to information that was disclosed for the purpose of service
        delivery. When the Client provides information, the team members are
        given a non-exclusive, free, non-assignable, and transferable license
        for the IP and information provided until the course of service delivery
        only. Based on the client&apos;s choice, the team is required to destroy
        or return the copies of IP after the delivery of the services. Only the
        results of the services can be used by the team members for their
        presentations and portfolios.
      </p>

      <h2 className='section-heading'>Confidentiality</h2>

      <p className='section-paragraph'>
        Each party should treat any information that is shared in the course of
        delivering the services confidentially. It should not be disclosed to
        any third party except to complete the contract. Reasonable procedures
        shall be implemented to prohibit misuse or unauthorised disclosure.
      </p>

      <h2 className='section-heading'>Suspension of Services</h2>

      <p className='section-paragraph'>
        With or without notice, the team can terminate the contract if the
        payment is not made or due information needed to complete the tasks is
        not provided within the stipulated period.
